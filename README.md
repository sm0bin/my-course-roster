## **State Management:**

In this assignment project, state management is achieved using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. The project tracks various pieces of information mentioned below:

- `courses`: Contains course details. Fetched during website initialization using `useEffect`.

Below state updates occur when user clicks the 'Select' button, triggering the `handleSelect` function to modify these values.

- `totalCredits`: Keeps track of the total credit hours of selected courses.
- `remainingCredits`: Calculates and displays the remaining credit hours within the 20-hour limit.
- `totalPrice`: Tracks the total cost of selected courses.
- `courseNames`: Stores the names of selected courses.
